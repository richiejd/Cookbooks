# Sublime setup for React/JS Development

General instructions for setting up sublime on a Mac

## Download Sublime

[Download Sublime Here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

## Setup package manager

You'll need to run a basic command, find it [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

## Download JS and React related packages

- Babel: adds syntax highlighting for js (make sure to set the files to use babel based on type)
- BracketHighlighter: improves the highlighting experience

## Update your user preferences

Go to sublime text -> preferences, add the following for User (these are my current, using 2-spaced tabs when doing personal development... because why do we need 2 extra spaces?)
```
{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Mariana.sublime-color-scheme",
	"ignored_packages": ["Vintage"],
	"font_size": 12,
	"margin": 4,
	"tab_size": 4,
	"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
	"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
	"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
	"scroll_speed": 1.2
}

```
